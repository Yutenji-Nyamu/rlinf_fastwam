# RoboTwin 2.0 — RLinf Support Status

<b>Contributed by RLinf team</b>

[RoboTwin 2.0](https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin.git) now includes **initial RLinf integration**, enabling reinforcement learning training across a wide range of robot manipulation tasks.  

At this stage, **RLinf-style reward functions have been implemented for a subset of RoboTwin tasks**.  
Support for the remaining tasks is actively under development.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

We are continuously extending RLinf reward support to **all RoboTwin 2.0 tasks**, including more complex long-horizon manipulation and multi-object interaction scenarios.

New task support and reward refinements will be released incrementally.
